It took me 15 minutes thinking of what i should write as my first post. I do not want to think much since i am in a rush, promised wife that we are going back to Sungai Petani tonight amid the traffic jam.

Configuring neovim is not as linear as i thought. Started watching tutorials on youtube, Henry Misc specifically, building my configuration brick by brick but ended up with broken config in the end. Spent days in tinkering it but nothing work. I rm rf-ed the whole thing and use LazyVim which is suprisingly easy with proper documentations. Really you should try it out!

This is a snapshot and summary of my current workspace, I try to keep the plugins parallel.
