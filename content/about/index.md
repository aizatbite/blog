Hey, I'm Aizat.

Currently learning everything I can about LLMs from training them locally, running inference, and figuring out how they actually work.

This blog is basically my diary for tracking progress. In a field that moves this fast, it's easy to forget how much you've learned. Writing things down keeps me honest about whether I'm actually moving forward.

You'll find posts about data science, machine learning, linux, cloud, data engineering and workflow optimization. I only write about stuff I'm actively working on or diving deep into. No fluff, just the experiments and technical problems I think are worth documenting.

I believe in atomic progress. Small steps, every day. Be better than yesterday. That's it.

If you're working on similar stuff, let's connect.
